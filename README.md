# Handwritten digit of MNIST database recognition with Java

Java implementation of handwritten digit recognition with the popular "MNIST" database. Created during the programming practicum of artificial intelligence course at the University of Paris Dauphine.

## Features
 * Implementation of the descent gradient algorithm in two cases : single layer and one hidden layer.
 * User interface to start learning and ploting the result.

## Result
 * Accuracy reaches 95,7% with one hidden layer of 48 neurons after 10 iterations through the database.
